# Fooling Code

This is the code base used to reproduce the "fooling" images in the paper:

## Requirements
This is an installation process that requires two main software packages (included in this package):

1. Caffe: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org
  * Our libraries installed to work with Caffe
    * Cuda 6.0
    * Boost 1.52
    * g++ 4.6
2. Sferes: https://github.com/jbmouret/sferes2
  * Our libraries installed to work with Sferes
    * OpenCV 2.4.10
    * Boost 1.52
    * g++ 4.9 (a C++ compiler compatible with C++11 standard)

Note: These are specific versions of the two frameworks with our additional work necessary to produce the images as in the paper. They are not the same as their master branches.

## Installation

Please see the [Installation_Guide](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling/wiki/Installation-Guide) for more details.

## Usage

* An MNIST experiment (Fig. 4, 5 in the paper) can be run directly on a local machine (4-core) within a reasonable amount of time (around ~5 minutes or less for 200 generations).
* An ImageNet experiment needs to be run on a cluster environment. It took us ~4 days x 128 cores to run 5000 generations and produce 1000 images (Fig. 8 in the paper). 
* [How to configure an experiment to test the evolutionary framework quickly](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling/wiki/How-to-test-the-evolutionary-framework-quickly)
* To reproduce the gradient ascent fooling images (Figures 13, S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7 from the paper), see the [documentation in the caffe/ascent directory](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling/tree/ascent/caffe/ascent). You'll need to use the `ascent` branch instead of master, because the two required versions of Caffe are different.

Please refer to the licenses of Sferes and Caffe projects.
